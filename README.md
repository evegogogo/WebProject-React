## Overview

CrazyFit a fitness web application that intends to help people who want to lose weight and keep a healthy lifestyle. This website provides healthy food recipes, food intake tracker, exercise calories tracker and an alarm to record exercise. Our goal is to help people stay on track and reach the goal.

### Iteration 2

In iteration 2, we we developed CRUD modules, queries and mutations. In addition, we created an authenticated login and signup form, so that users can log in and see the personal information. In the recipes page, the users can search relative recipes by the key words, such as apple and banana. In the food and exercise pages, the users can add the food and exercise by calories, status and date. In addition, the users can delete and like the food and exercise. In the alarm page, the users can set the time to exercise and the alarm will sound to remind the user. In the history page, the users' record will show by the date and in the descending order.

### Iteration 1

In iteration 1, we built the overall structure of the website and created the React components to realize the functionality we want to build. 

For the UI part, we created the basic components that will be used in later development stages. We use recipe API to get recipes based on users' search, render basic layout, and navbar of the web site.
